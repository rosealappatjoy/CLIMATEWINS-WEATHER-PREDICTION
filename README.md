# CLIMATEWINS-WEATHER-PREDICTION
To leverage advanced machine learning techniques for predicting and analyzing climate change impacts across Europe.
## Objective
This project is a continuation of the project CLIMATEWINS.Climate Wins wants to use machine learning to predict the impact of climate change in Europe and possibly worldwide. As a data analyst, my job is to find the best resources for predicting climate changes where people live using machine learning methods.
## ClimateWins: Our Focus Areas
-  Finding new patterns in weather changes over the last 60 years.
-  Identifying weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe.
-  Determining whether unusual weather patterns are increasing.
-  Generating possibilities for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years based
   on current trends.
-  Determining the safest places for people to live in Europe within the next 25 to 50 years
##  Date set
  The data set(https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/da-spec-ml/Scripts/A2/DATASET%20weather_prediction_dataset_processed.csv) is collected by the European 
  Climate Assessment & Data Set project
